excerpt: 'In this paper, we present TripNet, an end-to-end system that uses a gated attention architecture to model fine-grained textual and visual representations in order to align text and video content. Furthermore, TripNet uses reinforcement learning to efficiently localize relevant activity clips in long videos, by learning how to intelligently skip around the video.'
