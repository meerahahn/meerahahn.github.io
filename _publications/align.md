title: "Localizing and Aligning Fine-Grained Actions to Sparse Instructions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/align
excerpt: 'We present a system for automatically generating an alignment between a recipe and a first-person video demonstrating how to prepare the dish. Our approach uses egocentric cues to generate a concise set of action proposals, which are then matched to recipe steps using object detections and computational linguistic techniques.'
