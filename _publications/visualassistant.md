excerpt: 'The goal of this work was to create more semantically rich embeddings for verbs. The approach modified the word embedding architecture to incorporate semantic role labels and dependencies. Additionally, this work introduces novel quantitative evaluations for embedding for all parts of speech. This work was done at Emory University under Dr. Jinho Choi. This was my undergraduate thesis from Emory University that examines new approaches to Word Embedding and proposes novel methods for word embedding evalutation.'

excerpt: 'We introduce a novel interface for large scale collection of human memory and assistance.Using the interface we collect the `The Visually Grounded Memory Assistant Dataset' which is aimed at developing our understanding of (1) the information people encode during navigation of 3D environments and (2) conditions under which people ask for memory assistance.'
