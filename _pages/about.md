I am a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. I am advised by James M. Rehg have the pleasure of working closely with Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh. At Georgia Tech I have also collaborated with Peter Anderson and Stefan Lee. My research interests are primarily focused on multi-modal modeling of vision and natural language for applications in artificial intelligence. My long-term research goal is to develop multi-modal systems capable of supporting robotic or AR assistants for robotic assistants. My research currently revolves around training embodied agents (in simulation) to perform complex semantic grounding tasks.
 
In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at FAIR working with Abhinav Gupta. 
In the summer of 2019, I was a research intern at Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) working with James Hillis and Dhruv Batra. In the summer of 2018, I was a research intern at NEC Labs working with Asim Kadav and Hans Peter Graf.

As an undergraduate at Emory University, I worked in a Natural Language Processing lab for two years under [Dr. Jinho Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html). I also spent a summer working with [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/person/mubarak-shah/) at University of Central Florida.
