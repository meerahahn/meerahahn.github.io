I am a Computer Science PhD student, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I work in Dr. James M. Rehg's lab and my research focuses on using natural language to aid in computer vision tasks. My projects thus far have focused on Visual Question answering and human activity understanding. Before graduate school, I attended Emory University and graduated with my BS in Computer Science in May 2016. At Emory I worked in a Natural Language Processing lab for two years under Dr. Jinho Choi. During my undergraduate carrer I also worked at University of Central Florida's computer vision lab under Dr. Mubarak Shah.
